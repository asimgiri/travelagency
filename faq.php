                Normally, you can do the two kind of trekking in the Himalaya. They are: camping Himalaya Trekking Holiday and tea house Himalaya Trekking Holiday. When you are doing a camping Trekking holiday during that situation, yours trekking
                crew like: Sherpa, Guide, Sardar and potters will be organizing yours tent where acceptable facilities exist, normally we use that. You need not worry about that even you never camped before. The tent we are providing are roomy, the
                sleeping pads/mattress is comfortable. During yours Himalaya Trekking periods there is a bathroom tent and dining tent with tables and camp stools, providing a cozy, comfortable atmosphere to eat and chat with fellow trekkers during
                the evening.

                In the tea house Himalaya trekking holiday, you will be normally spend yours night in tea house. Actually Tea house is the combination of guesthouse, restaurant (Bhatti), house and social hang out. Our many years of experience along
                these routes have helped us fried least, cleanest and most enjoyable tea house with the best views. Most of the tea houses have running water. Many have hot water heated by kerosene, gas due to the lack of firewood in the most
                villages. Deforestation is being a big environmental concern in Himalayas. We always encourage to all ours trekkers along the Everest, Langtang, and Annapurna treks to try our tea house treks.

                Food safety is being always a big concern while in the Himalaya trekking. This is why we always do our best to choose tea houses with clean and sanitary kitchens. The food, which will serve during the camping Himalaya Trekking, is completely safe. On ours tea house Himalaya trekking, we provide a cook to prepare safe and testy meals with our own set of cookery as well as hygienic cleaning facilities.

Hot water is provided for washing and shaving, followed by breakfast water is provided for your water containers.

The full meal typically includes fresh fruit, tinned meat, cheese, rice chapattis or biscuits, cooked vegetables, and tea or coffee. We usually reach our campsite by 4 pm and have tea and biscuits shortly after wards. There is time to rest or explore before our evening meal at 6 pm. This is the social event of the day. It begins with an appetizer and soup, followed by the main course and desert with tea or coffee. The variety and quality of our “Camp” food will delight you. Guest keeps threatening to take our cooks home! As we mainly camp near villages, there is usually plenty of time to visit the locals before or after dinner and sample their home brews. After dinner yours guide will give you information about tomorrow’s program. In the same time you can chat with yours trekking crew about various matters.
